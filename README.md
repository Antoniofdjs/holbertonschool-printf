## Overview
The function `_printf` will replicate and handle some of the basic case specifiers from the C printf function and some advanced like hexa decimal, octal, and address conversions.

## Features
**Basic Format Specifiers**: Currently supports `%s` (strings), `%c` (characters), and `%d` `%i` (integers).


**More Format Specifiers**: Supports `%x` `%X` (hexadecimal),`%u` (unsigned integers), `%o` (octal).

## Use

``my_printf.c`` --- Contains `_printf` function.

``main.h`` --- All necessary headers and prototypes.

`num_functions.c` --- Has all functions that handle number cases.

`char_funtcions.c` --- Has all functions that handle character cases.
